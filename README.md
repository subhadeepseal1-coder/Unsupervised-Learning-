My Learnings:
📊 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Learned how to explore and visualize customer data to understand behavior patterns, such as: Spending habits Transaction frequency Engagement metrics Identified outliers and handled missing values to prepare data for modeling. ⚖️ 2. Data Preprocessing & Scaling: Understood the importance of scaling numerical data using techniques like StandardScaler to ensure fair distance-based clustering. Prepared multi-dimensional data for effective clustering through normalization and transformation. 🧠 3. Clustering Techniques & Concepts: Applied K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on similar usage patterns. Used Hierarchical Clustering to visualize relationships between customer groups through dendrograms. Gained a solid understanding of: Intra-cluster similarity Inter-cluster dissimilarity 📈 4. Evaluation of Clustering Results: Evaluated cluster quality using: Silhouette Score (for K-Means) Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient (for Hierarchical Clustering) Used Elbow Method and Dendrograms to determine optimal number of clusters. 🔍 5. Dimensionality Reduction: Applied techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce feature complexity and visualize clusters in 2D space. 👥 6. Cluster Profiling & Business Interpretation: Interpreted cluster characteristics to build customer personas, such as: High spenders with low engagement Frequent users with moderate spend Infrequent or dormant users Translated clustering insights into marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and service delivery recommendations. 💡 Overall Takeaway: Learned to apply unsupervised learning techniques to uncover hidden customer segments, enabling personalized marketing and data-driven business strategies. This project has enhanced ability to combine statistical modeling with business logic for real-world customer analytics.
